        <h3>Qualcomm VisionX: Reflection Removal <span class="date">Dec'24</span></h3>
        <p><strong>Standing</strong>4th out of 150+ teams</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Developed Transformer based reflection removal system with Cross-Scale Attention and Multi-Scale Fusion, achieving best PSNR of 23.61, SSIM of 0.835 with superior robustness against MSE & LPIPS attacks</li>
            <li>Designed a Triple-loss optimization framework (adversarial discriminator + GAN + perceptual loss) with transformer-based feature extraction, improved PSNR from 19.23 to 23.61 on subset of Pascal, Berkeley data</li>
            <li>Acheived Structural Similarity Index Measure above 0.752 against MSE and 0.768 under LPIPS attacks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Image Resolution for Super Resolution for Gaming Applications<span class="date">Jan'25-Apr'25</span></h3>
        <p><strong>Standing</strong>Rank 4 among 61 teams</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Developed and optimized deep learning pipelines to upscale images to x4 resolution using EDSR architecture</li>
            <li>Implemented EDSR++ with Charbonnier Loss, outperforming state-of-the-art models like RCAN and SwinIR</li>
            <li>Integrated Mixed Precision Training (AMP) and multi-GPU support, reducing training time and memory overhead, balancing pixel accuracy and perceptual quality to better reflect visual fidelity</li>
        </ul>
